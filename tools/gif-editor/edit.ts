 * (magi/03-gif-editor/PLAN.md §4b). Every function returns a *new* object;
 * neither the `EditState` passed in nor the `GifEncodeInput` passed to
 * `applyEdits` is ever mutated.
 *
 * Only depends on `GifEncodeInput` (not tools/gif-editor/decode.ts's
 * `DecodedGif`) so this module has zero coupling with the parallel decode.ts
 * lane -- `DecodedGif` is structurally assignable to `GifEncodeInput` (same
 * `frames`/`delaysMs`/`loop` shape), so decode.ts's output can be passed
 * straight into `createInitialEditState`/`applyEdits` without adaptation.

/**
 * Apply an EditState to its source animation, producing a GifEncodeInput
 * ready for `encodeGif`.
 *
 * Preconditions (thrown, not silently coerced):
 * - `state.keep` and `state.delaysMs` must both have the same length as
 *   `anim.frames` -- a mismatch only happens if `state` was built from a
 *   *different* animation than the one passed here, which is a caller bug
 *   worth surfacing immediately rather than guessing at an alignment.
 * - At least one frame must survive the keep filter -- deleting every frame
 *   would produce an empty (invalid) GIF. The UI is expected to prevent this
 *   at the source (e.g. disable delete on the last remaining frame) rather
 *   than relying on this throw as its primary guard.
 *
 * Filtering keeps `anim.frames` and `state.delaysMs` in lockstep: frame i is
 * kept (and its post-edit delay is `state.delaysMs[i]`) iff `state.keep[i]`
 * is true, so non-contiguous deletions still line up correctly.
 *
 * **Shared buffers warning**: every returned `frames[i]` is the *same* frame
 * object (and therefore the same underlying pixel buffer) as `anim.frames`'s
 * corresponding entry -- this function only filters the array, it never
 * copies pixel data. Safe today because nothing downstream mutates pixels in
 * place; any future code that does must copy a frame's buffer first.
